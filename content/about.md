This website is perpetually under development, especially now that I'm learning and migrating to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Everything worthwhile is getting converted to Markdown!

> Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.

Don't be surprised to find [Lorem Ipsum](https://lipsum.com/) dummy text, a few style sheets and JavaScript issues, or `draft` documents composed by other developers.

Mostly, you'll find posts written by me about the open-source software and technology I'm currently using or interested about. I've documented the majority of my self-hosted and cloud server deployments, all of which will soon have a place to call home.

This is my personal blog after all, so maybe the occasional rant about a horrible product or service, although probably not. You're more likely to learn what it's like raising a giant Neapolitan Mastiff puppy.
